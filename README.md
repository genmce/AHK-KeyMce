# AHK-KeyMce
Autohotkey - PC keyboard to mackie control universal emulation - mixing on the computer without a midi controller.
This program grew out of my work on genmce - a midi controller to mackie control universal emulation.
This also was a result of work with rockum on the ahk forum. This is fork of work we did.
I will clarify more of this soon.
The executable is in the zip file.
I will post the source, once I get it working well with unicode ahk.
